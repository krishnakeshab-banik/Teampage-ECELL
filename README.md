# E-Cell Teampage

This project is my contribution to the official website of the E-Cell Club of SRM Institute of Science and Technology. It provided me with a great opportunity to enhance my skills and apply everything I have learned so far. The project was led by **Anuj Tiwary**, Web Development Head.

## Project Overview

The E-Cell Teampage is designed to showcase the team members of the E-Cell Club in an interactive and responsive layout. The page highlights individual profiles with their roles and contributions in a clean, modern, and user-friendly format. This project allowed me to explore responsive design, interactive UI elements, and effective layout techniques, with styling powered by **Tailwind CSS**.

## Features

- **Team Member Display:** Showcases profiles of team members with their roles and contributions.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized layout for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements:** Includes smooth transitions and hover effects for an enhanced user experience.
- **Clean & Professional Aesthetic:** Minimalist design that aligns with the official websiteâ€™s look and feel.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the webpage.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling, layout, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript:** For adding interactive features *(if applicable)*.
